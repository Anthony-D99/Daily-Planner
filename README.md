# Daily Planner

# Description
This webpage can be used as a tool for the user to see and add events to their daily schedule. The time slots that are in grey have been passed already, time slots that are red represent the current hour, and the green time slots represent and time that is in the future. 

# How To Use
The user upon loading the webpage will be presented with a schedule planner that shows the date at the top and the time slots for each hour of the work day. Each hour time slot will change colors depending on the current time of day. Grey time slots represent the past, red for present, and green for future. The user can input text in each time slot to help keep track of each task that is needed to be done for the normal work day hours. After entering the desired text the user can click the save icon to the right of each respected text box to save their task or change the task that was originally there.
